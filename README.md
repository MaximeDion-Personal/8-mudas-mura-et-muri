# 8 mudas, mura & muri

The concepts of Muda, Mura, and Muri are part of the Lean Manufacturing philosophy, originating from the Toyota Production System. They represent different types of inefficiencies and wastes that should be minimized or eliminated to improve overall efficiency and productivity.

### 8 Mudas (Wastes)
Muda refers to activities that do not add value to the product or service and are considered wasteful. There are traditionally 7, but an 8th was added later to include a broader range of inefficiencies:

1. **Transport**: Unnecessary movement of products or materials, which can lead to damage, delays, and extra costs.
   
2. **Inventory**: Excess products or materials that are not currently being processed. This ties up capital and space and can lead to obsolescence.
   
3. **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people or equipment, which can result in time loss and increased wear and tear.
   
4. **Waiting**: Idle time when resources (people, equipment, materials) are not being used efficiently.
   
5. **Overproduction**: Producing more than is needed or producing it too soon, which can lead to waste and excess inventory.
   
6. **Overprocessing**: Doing more work or adding more features than are necessary, which can result in wasted effort and materials.
   
7. **Defects**: Products or services that are not up to standard, requiring rework or causing customer dissatisfaction.
   
8. **Unused Talent**: Not fully utilizing people’s skills, talents, and knowledge, leading to lower employee morale and productivity.

### Mura (Unevenness/Variability)
Mura refers to the inconsistencies and irregularities in processes that lead to waste. This can be seen in fluctuating production schedules, varying workloads, and inconsistent work practices. Mura can cause:

- **Bottlenecks**: When certain parts of the process cannot handle the workload.
- **Idle Time**: When workers or machines wait due to uneven distribution of tasks.
- **Quality Issues**: Due to rushed work during peak times and lack of engagement during slow periods.

### Muri (Overburden/Unreasonable)
Muri refers to the unnecessary strain placed on workers and machines by demanding more than they can handle. This can lead to:

- **Worker Stress**: Leading to errors, injuries, and high turnover.
- **Equipment Wear**: Leading to breakdowns and reduced lifespan.
- **Process Inefficiencies**: As overburdened systems and people cannot perform optimally.

### Reducing Muda, Mura, and Muri

To create a more efficient process, Lean practices focus on:

1. **Standardization**: Creating consistent processes to reduce Mura.
2. **Load Leveling (Heijunka)**: Distributing workloads evenly to prevent Mura and Muri.
3. **Empowerment**: Fully utilizing employee skills to avoid the 8th Muda.
4. **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Regularly seeking ways to reduce Muda, Mura, and Muri.
5. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Production**: Producing only what is needed, when it is needed, to minimize waste.

By focusing on eliminating Muda, reducing Mura, and preventing Muri, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance overall productivity.

Gaspillage = Gain potentiel
Habit can make waste invisible to people who are accustom to them.

### 7 types de gaspillages (Ohno)
1. provenant de la SURPRODUCTION
2. provenant des TEMPS D'ATTENTE
3. occasionnés par les TRANSPORTS (Never add value, so should always be reduced to minimum)
4. dus aux STOCKS INUTILES
5. dans les PROCESSUS de fabrication
6. dus aux MOUVEMENTS INUTILES
7. dus aux PIECES DÉFECTUEUSES (Increase the cost since you need to increase price to cover loss)
